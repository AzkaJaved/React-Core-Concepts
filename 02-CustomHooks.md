# React Custom Hooks

--> react custom hooks are just for the reusability purpose.

# i need reusability ----> Ui,Logic

# need ui reusability ----> create reusable components

# need logic reusability ----> create reusable function if there is no hook in logic

# need logic reusability ----> create custom hooks if there are hooks in logic

--> when u want to reuse a piece of Ui you make reusable componnets

but when you need to reuse some piece of logic you can make either regular reusable functions,or react custom hooks(if it nned two or more react hooks).

Regular functions or components can only receive props and always have to return JSX.
Custom hooks need to use one or more react hooks
